   <li style = "float: center;"> For this project, we used the framework Vue to dynamically update our table as well as 
   make our map and input box be two-way binded so that when you change the value in an input box, then it will also change the map and vice versa. 
   Addtionally, we used the Leaflet API to display the two maps as well as the Open AQ Platform API to read in air quality data. 
   We also used the Nominatim API to search via place name in addition to latitude or longitue coordinates to update the map accordingly.
