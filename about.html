  <h2>Description of Tools</h2>
    <ul id ="ulHomePage">
   <li style = "float: center;"> For this project, we used the framework Vue to dynamically update our table as well as
   make our map and input box be two-way binded so that when you change the value in an input box, then it will also change the map and vice versa.
   Addtionally, we used the Leaflet API to display the two maps as well as the Open AQ Platform API to read in air quality data.
   We also used the Nominatim API to search via place name in addition to latitude or longitue coordinates to update the map accordingly.

   <h2>Interesting Facts We Learned</h2>
       <ul id ="ulHomePage">
      <li style = "float: center;"> India and China seem to have the worst pollution worldwide. <br/><br/> Most of the United States has pretty good air quality, with even the most populated cities falling in the safe zone.
      <br/><br/> Despite how polluted the major cities in China are, the rural areas are very clean in comparison.  <br/><br/> Japan's air quality is comparable to the United States, which is surprising considering how high the population density in Japan is.
      <br/><br/> European cities such as Paris and London are much more polluted than expected, with many parts falling in at least the Yellow zone on the EPA scale. <br/><br/> With the wildfires over, almost all of California falls in the 'Moderate' category at worst, with only select areas being Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.
